# MachineLearning-Classifier-Model Evaluation 

# Overview

This project involves evaluating the performance of various machine learning classifiers on a given dataset. Each classifier has been trained and tested, and their accuracy scores have been recorded for comparison.

# Classifier Performance

Below are the accuracy scores achieved by each classifier:

- DecisionTree: 0.95256.
- Randomforest: 0.96924.
- Adaboost : 0.97148.
- SGD: 0.95856.
- supportvector: 0.94812.
- KNeighbors: 0.9528.
- NaiveBayes: 0.9032.
- Gradient: 0.97136.
- NearestCentroid: 0.85676.
- Neuralnetwork: 0.96136.
  
# Conclusion

From the evaluation results, it can be observed that the Gradient Boosting Classifier achieved the highest accuracy score of 0.97344, closely followed by the AdaBoost Classifier with a score of 0.97316. These classifiers seem to be well-suited for the given dataset. However, further analysis, including considering other metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model performance.
